Photo2Shape
-----------
Create point shapefile from a set of geotagged photos.

Requires exifread Python package (1.x or >=2.0.1).

NOTE: backward compatibility in tag names between exifread 1.x
and exifread 2.0.0 was broken. This was fixed by exifread 2.0.1.
If you have exifread 2.0.0 please use Photo2shape 0.4.0
